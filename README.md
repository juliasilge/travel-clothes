Please be specific. When possible, link to specific items. If it's sold out, try to include a similar product to illustrate. 

This particular project is laser focused on the intersection of comfort and style. Ideas should be right in that sweet spot and may be rejected if they're too far in either direction. They should be clothes or other wearable garments, not earphones and other travel tools.
