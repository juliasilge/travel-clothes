## "Travel uniform" ideas

"Leggings and an oversized shirt with vans/sneakers. I usually go with the white and black striped one [here](http://www2.hm.com/en_gb/productpage.0688873015.html) and roll up the sleeves and feels a bit tidier but still comfy due to baggy fit (which allows for sports bra if want to be super comfy etc)." -Sheree

"Not sure how grown up but my travel uniform is black tank top, black short or long sleeve shirt depending on season, black or gray cashmere sweater with black pants and black nikes. Always bring a scarf. Can wear any layer on its own. Can handle any weather, spill or delay." -Jessica

## Pants

Please feel free to submit pull requests with suggestions! Since this is all one page, you can even edit it right in your browser without cloning the repo—just hit the Edit button. 

Please be specific. When possible, link to specific items. If it's sold out, try to include a similar product to illustrate. 

This particular project is laser focused on the intersection of comfort and style. Ideas should be right in that sweet spot and may be rejected if they're too far in either direction. They should be clothes or other wearable garments, not earphones and other travel tools.
